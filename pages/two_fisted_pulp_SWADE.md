This is an effort to take the setting rules from several older Savage Worlds products and adapt them to *Savage Worlds Adventure Edition* (SWADE) games. The goal is to make the scenarios of the *Daring Tales of Adventure* series more usable for SWADE game masters and players.

## Setting rules

### Standard settings rules

Savage Worlds Adventure Edition has a number of setting rules that are perfect for running a two-fisted pulp game.

-   Conviction (SWADE p 136)

-   Creative Combat (SWADE p 137)

-   Dumb Luck (SWADE p 138)

-   Fanatics (SWADE p 138)

-   Fast Healing (SWADE p 139)

-   Heroes Never Die (SWADE p 140)

-   High Adventure (SWADE p 140)

-   Multiple Languages (SWADE p 149)

-   Wound Cap (SWADE p 141)

This setting also uses the Wealth rules (SWADE p 145) and extends them using the [Expanded Wealth](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/269971/Expanded-Wealth) rules from Donovan Bailey. For how I apply the wealth rules in Savage Worlds games, see [Wealth]({% link pages/wealth_sw.md %}).

### Special setting rules

The following rules and directions further tune the setting for a classic pulp action game.

#### Be the Hero

The protagonists are heroes.
Play them that way.
If a protagonist commits an evil, villainous, or morally ambiguous act, they lose a benny.
This benny loss reduces the protagonist’s benny maximum until the start of the next session.
For example, if the hero typically starts a session with 3 bennies, her benny limit would then be reduced to 2 for the duration of the session.

<div class="tip">

The GM should warn the player about this rule and the consequences of the action before the player’s hero commits an ignoble deed.

</div>

#### Stunts

A stunt action is any action that is performed in a flashier than normal way.
Any hero who attempts a stunt action deserves a benny.

In game terms, a stunt is an action where the player purposefully makes the action more difficult for the hero.
A stunt action always requires a trait roll, at a minimum -2 penalty.
The GM is the final arbiter of the roll penalty of a particular stunt action.

Conventional action  
Getting on board an airship before it lifts off from the platform is an action

Stunt action  
Leaping from the sidecar of a speeding motorcycle onto an airship at the last second as it lifts off from the platform.

#### Surrender

When the heroes surrender at a dramatically fitting place in the story and go along with the demands of the antagonists, each heroes takes a benny.

#### Pay It Forward

When a Wild Card gets more than one raise on any Trait roll (including Soak rolls), they receive a Benny as a way to pay their luck forward.

#### Cinematic Death

In a pulp game, death is not gory and messy.

#### Never-Ending Ammo

At the end of the scene, heroes recover all spent ammunition.

#### Police Interference

The cops do not turn up on the scene until after the action has ended.

## Creating Heroes

### Motivations

Suggested motivations:

### Races

Heroes are humans.

### Skills

#### Changed Skills

-   Electronics is reskinned as Gadgetry

#### Removed Skills

-   Hacking

-   Focus, applies to the Arcane Background (Gifted)

-   Faith, applies to the Arcane Background (Miracles)

-   Language (see the Multiple Languages setting rules in SWADE p 149)

-   Spellcasting, applies to the Arcane Background (Magic)

### Edges

#### Changed Edges

New Powers (SWADE p 47)  
The weird scientist adds **one** new power by choosing this Edge (which may be taken multiple times) *and* one new power trapping.
For the new power, the hero may choose from any powers of her Rank or lower that are normally available to Arcane Background (Weird Science).
For the new trapping, the hero adds a effect to an existing power.
For example, the hero might add an electrical Trapping to her existing freeze bolt, for example, so she could switch between shock and cold Trappings.

#### Removed Edges

-   Linguist (as per the Multiple Languages setting rules in SWADE p 149)

-   See [Arcane Backgrounds](#arcane_bg) for other unavailable edges

#### Arcane Backgrounds

Only the Weird Science arcane background is available for heroes.
Edges that are associated with unavailable arcane backgrounds are not available to heroes.

I do not think heroes control the minds of others, wipe others' memories, and project mental blasts.
Let’s focus on fists, bullets, and car chases and leave the superhuman and supernatural stuff to the big villains.

The unavailable edges are:

-   Extra Effort (SWADE p 46)

-   Holy/Unholy Warrior (SWADE p 46)

-   Mentalist (SWADE p 46)

-   Wizard (SWADE p 47)

We would likely build heroes such as the *The Shadow* and *Doc Savage* using **Arcane Background - Gifted**. Here we are focusing on a low-powered, classic pulp adventure game *a la* the Indiana Jones movies or the Mummy series.

### Hindrances

Cocky (minor)  
The character is a braggart and will typically spend the first round of any combat announcing how great he is, or what he’s going to do to any and all opponents.

Cocky is like a minor version of the Overconfident (major) hindrance (SWADE p 26). This could easily be considered as a trapping of the hindrance Quirk (minor).

### Powers

Fly (SWADE p 162)  
For heroes with the Arcane Background (Weird Science) edge, Fly is available at Novice rank.
